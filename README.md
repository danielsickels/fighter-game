First Portfolio Project

This is a simple text-based fighter game.
Two players required.
Follow the prompts of the choice of actions.

Different actions provide different buffs/debuffs, depending on the choice. 
Use these buffs to hurt the other player.

Currently, "Boost Speed" serves as a place holder for "pass," as in, that player is choosing to pass their turn.
The game play goes back and forth - one player chooses an action, it applies, then the other player gets their turn.

Hoping to implement speed as a way of determing player turn in the future. 

For now, enjoy this goofy text-based fight.
